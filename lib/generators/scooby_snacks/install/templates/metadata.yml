# Other Schema Files
#-------------------
# This section specifies other configuration files that contain
# metadata information. Each other metadata file may contain 
# any information that would be valid in this file. Schema information
# from all files is merged together.
# When possible, information from all files is combined. For example, 
# if a property is defined in one file, it cannot be un-defined in 
# another file, though more options can be added.
# Some options associated with properties can be defined in one file
# and overwritten by another. Options like this include 'required'
# and 'multiple'. 
# Other options must be defined only once per property
# and cannot be overwritten. These include "predicate" and "definition". 





#-------------------
# Property Settings
#-------------------
# This section defines every metadata property that can be used 
# in the system. Individual work types may override some settings 
# defined here. Predicates for each property should be defined
# here, and cannot be overridden once defined.

# Class Settings
#-------------------
# This sections defines classes of nested objects defined in 
# the system that are not PCDM works. These may be used as the objects
# of predicates, and may have their own predicates applied.  
# Here, we define which properties are available to each Class.

# Work Type Settings
#-------------------
# Here we define metadata settings based on work type.
# This section specifies which properties (defined above)
# may be applied to each work type, and may specify display
# settings such as "required" or "hidden".
# 
# In the future, this may be extended to actually define 
# the work types for the application here.

# RDF Namespaces

# Here we can define additional namespaces for rdf predicates.
# The most common namespaces are predefined by the system, but
